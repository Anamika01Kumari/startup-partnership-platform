Startup-Partnership-Platform


1. Overview
   

This project is a Startup Benefits and Partnerships Platform designed for early-stage startups, founders, and small teams. The main goal of the platform is to help startups access useful SaaS deals that are usually expensive during the early stage.

Some deals are publicly available, while certain premium deals are locked and require user verification before they can be claimed.




2. Target Users
   

Startup founders

Early-stage teams

Indie hackers




3. Core Application Flow
   

A user registers and logs into the platform

The user browses available SaaS deals

Locked deals are visually restricted and clearly show eligibility requirements

Eligible users can claim a deal

Claimed deals appear in the user dashboard with status tracking such as pending or approved



4. Frontend Architecture
   

The frontend is planned using Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript.

Main pages included:

Landing Page with an animated hero section

Deals Listing Page with basic filters and search

Deal Details Page showing eligibility and claim action

User Dashboard displaying claimed deals

Basic animations are planned for page transitions, hover interactions, and loading states to improve user experience while keeping the UI simple and easy to use.



5. Backend Architecture
   

The backend is designed using:

Node.js with Express.js

MongoDB with Mongoose

REST APIs

JWT-based authentication

Core entities in the system:

User

Deal

Claim

Protected routes ensure that unverified users are not allowed to claim locked deals.




6. Authentication & Authorization
   

Users authenticate using JWT tokens after login

JWT tokens are required to access protected APIs

Authorization logic ensures:

Only logged-in users can claim deals

Locked deals require additional verification before claiming




7. Claim Deal Flow
   

The user clicks on the claim deal button

The backend checks user eligibility and deal access level

A claim record is created with the status set to pending

Admin approval is planned as a future enhancement to update the claim status to approved




8. UI & Animation Strategy
   

Page-level transitions for smooth navigation

Micro-interactions on buttons and deal cards

Loading skeletons to improve perceived performance

Locked deals use visual overlays to clearly communicate restricted access

Animations are used only where necessary to avoid clutter and overuse.



9. Known Limitations
    

Admin verification and approval flow is not fully implemented

Advanced animations and 3D elements are not included

Production-level security and scalability optimizations are pending



10. Future Improvements
    

Admin dashboard for deal and claim approval

User verification workflows

Performance optimization and caching

Deployment with CI/CD pipeline



11. Conclusion
    

This project focuses on understanding system flow, maintaining a clean structure, and applying basic product thinking rather than implementing excessive features. The current version is designed to clearly demonstrate the overall architecture and planned functionality of the platform.
